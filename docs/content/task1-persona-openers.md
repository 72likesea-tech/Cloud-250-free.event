# 작업 1 — 페르소나와 먼저 말 걸기 규칙

- 작성: Claude (원래 GPT 담당 작업. 사용자 결정 (가)에 따라 대신 작성, 2026-09-26)
- 앱이 읽는 원본 데이터: `app/src/main/assets/content_pack.json`
- 작성 원칙: 초급 상~중급 하, 한 문장 12단어 안팎, 오프닝마다 질문 1개, 오프닝은 항상 `work / travel / {debate_question}` 세 선택지로 끝남, '의견과 토론(opinion and debate)'이라는 말은 쓰지 않음.

## 1. 페르소나

| 안 | 이름 | 말투 | 다정함 | 유머 | 어울리는 상황 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A (추천)** | **Mia** | 옆자리 동료처럼 편한 구어체, 짧은 문장 | 높음 | 가볍게 | 오후에 갑자기 말을 걸어도 부담이 적음 |
| B | Sam | 차분한 코치, 또박또박 | 중간 | 거의 없음 | 교정·연습 느낌이 강함 |
| C | Jake | 에너지 넘치는 친구, 감탄사 많음 | 높음 | 많음 | 재미있지만 지치는 날엔 부담 |

**추천: Mia.** 잠긴 휴대폰에서 소리가 갑자기 나오는 앱이라 첫인상이 부드러워야 합니다. 말하기 부담을 줄이는 것이 이 앱의 목적에 가장 잘 맞습니다.
- TTS 음성: 영어(미국) 여성 음성, 속도 0.9~0.95배 (3단계 기본값, 설정에서 조정 가능)

## 5. 한국어로 답하거나 "모르겠어"라고 할 때 (10개)

| 영어로 유도 | 화면에 보여줄 한국어 힌트 |
| --- | --- |
| That's okay! Try it in English, just a few words. For example: I'm busy today. | 짧게라도 영어로 말해 보세요. 예: I'm busy today. |
| Good idea! Now let's say it in English. You can start with: I think... | 'I think...'(제 생각에는)로 시작해 보세요. |
| No problem. Let me make it easier: do you like it, yes or no? | Yes나 No로만 답해도 괜찮아요. |
| I hear you! Try one English word first. Just one. | 먼저 영어 단어 하나만 말해 보세요. |
| That's fine! You can say: I'm not sure, but... and keep going. | '잘 모르겠지만'은 I'm not sure, but... 이에요. |
| Nice try! In English, maybe: It was a long day. Now you try. | 제가 한 문장을 들려드렸어요. 따라 말해 보세요. |
| Don't worry about mistakes. Just say it simply, like texting a friend. | 틀려도 괜찮아요. 친구에게 문자하듯 쉽게 말해요. |
| Let's go smaller. Is your day good or bad so far? | good 또는 bad 한 단어로 시작해 보세요. |
| Okay! Try this: I don't know much about it, but I think... | '잘 모르지만 제 생각에는' = I don't know much about it, but I think... |
| Almost there! Say it in English and I'll help you with it. | 영어로 말해 보시면 자연스럽게 다듬어 드릴게요. |
